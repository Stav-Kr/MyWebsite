            <h4>Who am I?</h4>
            <p>
                I am Stavros! A physics undergraduate student, originally from Greece, currently living in the UK. After I started my physics degree, I discorvered through my computing modules that I really like programming! So, for the past couple of years I've been improving my programming skills and particularly focusing on areas such as Data analysis/Scientific computing due to the nature of my studies. Oh, I also started learning HTML and CSS to build myself this website. Feel free to click on the links if you want to learn more about my projects and work!
                Have a good day and thank you for visiting my website!
