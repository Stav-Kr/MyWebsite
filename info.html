    <p class="me">
        A physics undergraduate student with a passion for programming, currently living in the
        UK. For the past few 
        years I've been improving my programming skills and particularly focusing on areas such as Data
        analysis/Scientific computing due to the nature of my studies.
        I also started learning HTML and CSS to build myself this website.
        Feel free to click on the links if you want to learn more about my projects and work!
        Have a good day and thank you for visiting my website!
