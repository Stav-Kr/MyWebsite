        A physics undergraduate student, originally from Greece, currently living in the UK. After I started my physics
        degree, I discovered, through my computing modules, that I really like programming! So, for the past couple of
        years I've been improving my programming skills and particularly focusing on areas such as Data
        analysis/Scientific computing due to the nature of my studies.
        Oh, I also started learning HTML and CSS to build myself this website.
        Feel free to click on the links if you want to learn more about my projects and work!
        Have a good day and thank you for visiting my website!
